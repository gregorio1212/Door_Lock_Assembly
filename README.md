# Door_Lock_Assembly

Door Lock program for ATmega328p in Assembly

This program is based on a sound feedback. We have a door lock that utilizes two input buttons and you must input
the sequence expected by the microcontroller. If you press a wrong button, a buzzer is activated for a moment. It shows
that you missed the expected sequence. Once the expected sequence is pressed, we have the four green LEDS blinking for a
moment. It serves as a feedback information showing you successfully entered the sequence.

A short presentation video shows the system working:
